# Sudoku Solver Project

## Overview

This JavaScript-based Sudoku solver project employs functions, arrays, and looping structures to efficiently solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. The solver follows a logical approach to deduce and fill in missing values within the puzzle grid.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. Provide an efficient and logical Sudoku solver.
2. Represent the puzzle state and solution in a structured manner.
3. Offer easy interpretation of column and row values within the puzzle.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The solver is implemented in JavaScript for its versatility and browser compatibility.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
2. Run the main JavaScript file (e.g., `sudoku.js`) using a JavaScript runtime or a web browser console.
